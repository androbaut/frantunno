        <h1>About Fran</h1>
        <p>Fran is a copywriter, award-winning blogger, freelance writer, Audie nominated audiobook narrator, voice actress, avid baker, and cook.</p>
        <p>Originally from New Brighton, Pennsylvania — near Pittsburgh, she has managed to banish yinz from her vocabulary but not from her heart, and after forty years in Los Angeles, has moved back to the Pittsburgh area to be closer to family.</p>
        <p>She grew up the youngest of four, born to Italian immigrant parents, whose faith in her was boundless. Her mom encouraged her to read out loud from the time she was five. This activated the ham gene that has served her well over the years.</p>
        <p>If her name sounds familiar, it’s because she was a traffic and news reporter on morning radio in Los Angeles for 12 years...</p>
        <p>Storytelling is where Fran shines. Her favorite stories are about growing up Italian American in the ’60s and ’70s. The stories inspired her to start <a href="https://atfranstable.com" target="_blank">AtFransTable.com</a>, a blog filled with tales about her mom, her family, and, of course, food.</p>
        <p>When she’s not writing or recording, she can be found trying to entice people to come over and eat.</p>
